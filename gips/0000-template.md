(*All lists should comprise comma-separated elements. All dates are in ISO 8601 format.*)

*This is a template GIP proposal showing the layout and formatting described in GIP 0001. Italicized writing are comments and should be removed or replaced. Sections marked optional may also be removed if left empty.*

*All GIPs MUST include a preamble, in RFC 822 format, preceded and followed by three dashes ("â€”-"). This formatting aids in compatibility with most static site generators.*

*Given the heterogeneous types of proposals this template is meant to reflect, most sections below, except "Abstract" and "Motivation," may be treated as optional. The author, however, should exercise good judgment in deviating from the template, as they are reflective of the type of information, when relevant, that editors will look for in reviewing a proposal.*

## Abstract
