# **Abstract**

This GIP proposes using an optimistic oracle to translate epochs from any chain to Arbitrum One. This approach replaces the current Epoch Block Oracle (EBO) design with a new optimistic version, called Optimistic EBO, which synchronizes the clock across indexed chains supported by The Graph.

# **Motivation**

The first version of the EBO, introduced in [GIP-0038](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0038-epoch-block-oracle/3323), prioritized simplicity but introduced a potential single point of failure. With the protocol's [migration to Arbitrum](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0043-activate-indexing-rewards-in-the-graph-network-on-arbitrum-one/3999) and the upcoming [Horizon update](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0066-introducing-graph-horizon-a-data-services-protocol/5989), which will enable the integration of arbitrary data services, The Graph should continue its progressive decentralization efforts by further decentralizing the Epoch Block Oracle.

# **Prior Art**

Several approaches have been proposed to improve the oracle process within The Graph protocol:

- [Submitting recent blocks for POIs](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/require-that-more-recent-pois-are-submitted-in-order-to-collect-indexing-rewards-multi-blockhain-pois/2500)
- [On-chain epoch oracle](https://hackmd.io/KHLuc4haR5uCnmpMu0Ce7Q)

> Before adopting the optimistic approach, expanding the number of EBO operators to 3-5 Council-authorized organizations was considered. However, the design proposed in this GIP provides greater decentralization, reducing the potential for coordinated corruption and the reliance on the Council as a single point of failure.

## Current status of Epoch Block Oracle

The EBO defines the source of truth for the block number corresponding to a new epoch in each indexed chain. It fetches the block for each epoch on each chain and records it on-chain on the protocol chain (Arbitrum One). An epoch is a period determined by the [EpochManager](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/epochs/EpochManager.sol), which lasts approximately one day but is measured in blocks.

Indexers use the EBO subgraph to get the block number for each chain and use it to build the POI (Proof Of Indexing), which is published when closing allocations to claim rewards.

If a dispute arises, an indexer who publishes a POI for the wrong block may be disputed by a fisherman and penalized by the Arbitrator.

The EBO is composed of 3 parts:

- A Rust process that reads information from RPCs.
- A [Data Edge](https://github.com/graphprotocol/block-oracle/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/DataEdge.sol) contract where updates get posted (compressed and encoded).
- A [Subgraph](https://github.com/graphprotocol/block-oracle/tree/main/packages/subgraph) that indexes the Data Edge allowing indexers to easily craft their POI.

### Current design

The current system is run by a single Operator, which is the largest trust assumption of the EBO.

![EBO Design.png](../assets//gip-0080/Optimistic-EBO-Designs.png)

### The Risks

- **Single Operator risk**: The current system is run by a single operator, which is the most prominent trust assumption of the EBO. There have been discussions around increasing the committee of validators/proposers.
- **Liveness risks**: If the owner fails to update the EBO, indexers won’t have a reference block to build their POIs, preventing them from closing their allocations or risk slashing if they register a POI for an incorrect block. The system must be redundant to mitigate this risk.
- **Fork risks**: There might be uncertainty around the correct fork choice when updating the EBO since it is not a fork oracle. For future verifiability efforts, it will likely be necessary to include blockhash in addition to the block number in the EBO’s output, making this even more important.

# **High-Level Description**

## Optimistic EBO Solution Considerations

The goal of this solution is to decentralize the EBO while keeping the structure open for future modifications.

**Key improvements:**

- **Optimistic operators:** Adopting an open and permissionless model will improve decentralization, redundancy, and scalability
- **Timestamp comparison:** Instead of querying each RPC when detecting a new epoch, a delay is introduced to compare timestamps, reducing time sensitivity and improving the precision of fork selection
- **Escalating bond mechanism:** An escalating bond dispute system is introduced to reduce Arbitrator intervention and enable lower initial stakes without compromising security
- **Secure Source of Truth:** The Council-owned multisig is kept as the source of truth for dispute resolution, ensuring security in the initial phase while allowing for future upgrades


### Optimistic Design

![EBO Current.png](../assets//gip-0080/Optimistic-EBO.png)

### **Optimistic operators**

The optimistic approach allows off-chain agents to propose updates to the Optimistic EBO. Other participants can dispute these updates, which triggers an escalation period during which votes can be cast for or against the dispute. If a maximum number of escalations is reached, the dispute is resolved by an arbitrator appointed by The Graph's Council.

The process works as follows:

- Any bonded actor can submit a proposal, which remains open for disputes for a set period. If no disputes are raised within that window, the proposal can be finalized
- If a bonded actor believes the proposal is incorrect, they can start a dispute, which automatically discards the original proposal. Disputers are incentivized to submit a corrected proposal
- Once a dispute starts, bonded actors can vote `for` or `against` it by pledging their support. The winning side is determined by having more votes, surpassing the opposing side by a configurable margin. Each vote resets the voting time window
- In the event of a dispute, the resolution mechanism is triggered. The winning side's voters are rewarded with the bonds from the losing side. If both sides reach the maximum number of escalations, the dispute is escalated to an arbitrator
- Once the dispute is resolved, the valid proposal is finalized

<aside>
📌

Operators can update the block number of one chain at a time, allowing for ongoing disputes and resolutions for each updated chain. This improves the system's scalability.

</aside>

### Timestamp Comparison

Implementing a slight delay in timestamp comparison allows for safer EBO operations, significantly reducing risks related to RPC liveness and fork choice (finality) in exchange for a slight they delay in reward distribution:

- **Check the timestamp from the first block of the new epoch in the protocol chain (Arbitrum One).**
- **Check the block number for each indexed chain at that timestamp.**

The following methods can be used to prove that a specific block number corresponds to a claimed timestamp:

- Check the timestamps of two consecutive blocks $t_N$ and $t_{N+1}$. If the timestamp value from the protocol chain $t_0$ lives in the range $[t_N,t_{N+1}]$, then $N$ is the first block corresponding to the new epoch.
- Check a single block timestamp $t_N$ and an average block measure defined per chain $\Delta_i$. If the timestamp value from the protocol chain $t_0$ lives in the range $[t_N,t_N+\Delta_i]$, then $N$ is the first block corresponding to the new epoch.

### Escalating bond

To reduce the number of calls to the Arbitrator, we will implement an escalating bond system:

- Anyone can dispute while the dispute window is open and if staked. To dispute, you need to post a bond.
    - The resolution system is triggered once the participants have completed the maximum number of rounds.
    - If the disputant “overtakes” the Min Bond, the answer is considered incorrect until the proposer responds. The proposer must overtake the disputant's Bond to escalate the answer further. This process can be repeated up to N times.
- After each dispute, the original update gets deleted and can be answered again, even before resolution. This option makes the process quicker for the requester. This answer can be disputed using the same method as described above.
    - An honest proposer will be rewarded more for the won resolution than the original update.
    - Disputers are incentivized to post the new answer, as they have already computed the query.

The “overtake” mechanism improves resolution time and reduces Arbitrator calls, while the second answer (before resolution) improves the answering time to the request. 

![EBO Dispute Escalation.png](../assets/gip-0080/Optimistic-EBO-Dispute-Escalation.png)

<aside>
📌

The escalating bond mechanism functions similarly to the justice system's appeal process, with the Council taking on the role of the Supreme Court.

</aside>

**Source of Truth**

If the escalating bond mechanism cannot resolve a dispute, the Arbitrator will be the final instance and ultimate source of truth, though this could change in the future.

There are other possible sources of truth for the protocol to verify the timestamp of a block on-chain:

- **Canonical bridges**: This is the most secure option since it shares the chain’s security, but on optimistic chains, it can introduce significant delays due to the mainnet withdrawal period
- **Third-party bridges**: Less secure but varying in their levels of trust.
    - **Light client-based bridges**: These use light clients to update block headers with timestamps, but no battle-tested solutions exist yet.
    - **Bridge aggregators**: Combine results from multiple bridges, like [Hashi](https://github.com/gnosis/hashi) or [LayerZero](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/home/modular-security/security-stack-dvns) for EVMs, although it requires additional development
    - Other bridges require case-by-case analysis.

> Using an Arbitrator (a Council of qualified individuals selected by the governance) is the simplest way to launch the system at this early stage and manage all the chains with a single resolution mechanism. This approach allows for greater decentralization in the future, as the source of truth can be easily migrated.

**Some considerations**:

- Implementing multiple resolution systems by chain or type (rollups, L1s, etc) adds complexity.
- The Council should upgrade the system to accommodate future improvements.
- Disputes should be managed per-chain to prevent a single dispute from impacting the entire system.

## Proposal Lifecycle

### **Definitions**

- **Proposal bond size**: the amount staked and provisioned in `HorizonStaking` needed to create or dispute a proposal.
- **Pledge Bond Size:** The amount staked in `HorizonStaking` that represents a single pledge. One pledge is required when calling the pledge function for the **`first`** time. Subsequent calls will require exactly **`two`** pledges to surpass the opposing party, unless the maximum **`maxPledgesNumber`** is reached with the last pledge.
- **Proposal Creation**: The block timestamp when a proposal is created.
- **Dispute Window**: The period users can challenge a proposal before it is finalized and deemed valid.
- **Pledge Window**: If a proposal is disputed, this represents the minimum duration during which users can pledge either in support of or against the dispute (provided that the maximum number of pledges for both sides has not been reached beforehand).
- **Max Number of Pledges:** The maximum number of pledges permitted per side in a dispute.
- **Pledge Refresh Window:** This window opens after a user places a pledge, allowing others to pledge on the opposing side. It operates independently of the pledge time window and can remain open as long as the previous Pledge Refresh Window is active, up to the maximum number of pledges.
- **Arbitrator Resolution Window**: The time required for the arbitrator to resolve an escalated dispute.
- **Min Thawing Period**: The minimum duration a user must wait to thaw their tokens in the `HorizonStaking` contract, ensuring compatibility with EBO's most extended possible proposal life cycle scenario.

### **Parameters, Formulas, and Recommendations**

**Minimum Thawing Period Calculation**

To determine the `Minimum Thawing Period` (`minThawingPeriod`), the maximum possible duration of a proposal's lifecycle is calculated. This calculation is based on the longest-case scenario, which assumes every action (disputing, pledging) is taken at the last possible moment.

The `maxProposalLifecycleDuration` is the sum of `disputeWindow`, `pledgeWindow`, `maxCumulativePledgeRefreshWindow` (the sum of all pledge refresh windows), and `arbitratorResolutionWindow`. The `minThawingPeriod` must always be greater than or equal to this maximum duration

**Recommendation Values and Example**

The following initial parameter values are suggested:

- **Dispute Window**: 12 hours
- **Pledge Window**: 2 days
- **Pledge Refresh Window**: 1 day
- **Proposal Bond Size**: 15K GRT
- **Pledge Bond Size**: 15K GRT
- **Max Number of Pledges**: 4

<aside>
📌

**Goal:** We are aiming for approximately five rounds (pledge calls). Applying these values to the calculation, the total `_maxProposalLifecycleDuration` is `12h + 48h + 96h (4*24h) + 168h (7*24h) = 324h`, which equals 13.5 days. Therefore, the `_minThawingPeriod` must be greater than or equal to 13.5 days.

## Off-Chain Agents

### **Architecture and Role**

The EBO Agent is a standalone process that monitors events on the protocol chain (Arbitrum) and responds to them to automate EBO workflows. Its primary responsibility is to interact with the EBO smart contracts and perform the necessary block calculations to propose, validate, or dispute responses on the chains supported by The Graph.

### **Capabilities**

- Create requests for new epochs.
- Propose responses (block numbers).
- Dispute incorrect proposals.
- Participate in the dispute escalation process (pledging).
- Finalize proposals that do not escalate to the arbitrator.

### **Modular Design**

The agent consists of two main modules to separate concerns:

- **DisputeModule**: Manages all dispute-related activities, operating reactively to on-chain events.
- **BlockNumberModule**: Is exclusively responsible for computing the block number corresponding to a specific timestamp for any supported chain.

### **Limitations**

The system is not designed to handle disputes that escalate to the Arbitrator for final resolution, as this process is handled directly by The Graph's Arbitrator.

## **External Contracts Integration**

EBO's integration focuses on two main external contracts: `HorizonStaking` and `EpochManager`. In the context of EBO, the `service provider` is the actor posting a bond (proposer, disputer), while the `verifier` is always the EBO contract itself.

### **`HorizonStaking` Integration**

- **Funding Provision**: Before interacting with EBO, participants must stake and provision GRT tokens in the `HorizonStaking` contract, specifying the EBO contract as the `verifier`.
- **Provision Verification**: EBO uses the `getProvision` function from `HorizonStaking` to verify that an actor's provision meets the minimum requirements, such as the `minThawingPeriod` and a `maxVerifierCut` of 100%.
- **Bond Validation**: To secure funds, EBO validates that an actor's committed bonds do not exceed their locked tokens that are not in the process of being thawed (`_tokensNotThawing`). The EBO contract internally tracks bonds to prevent double-spending of the same funds.
- **Slashing**: EBO calls the `slash` function on `HorizonStaking` to penalize actors who lose a dispute. The funds are transferred from the penalized actor to the corresponding winners.

### **`EpochManager` Integration**

EBO interacts with the `EpochManager` to validate epochs. When creating a proposal, it calls the `currentEpoch` function to ensure that the proposal corresponds to a valid (current or past) epoch and not a future one.

# **Dependencies**

The [horizon staking contract](https://github.com/graphprotocol/contracts/pull/944), as described in [GIP-0066](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/gips/0066-graph-horizon.md), needs to be deployed to integrate with it.
