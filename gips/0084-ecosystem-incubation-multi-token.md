## Abstract

This GIP proposes a simple incubation framework for new ecosystem projects, where:

- the ecosystem sets up an incubation program governed by The Graph Foundation;

- projects in the program get access to (optional) ecosystem resources:
    - The Graph Foundation-led funding and/or capital access;
    - support and assistance from the Foundation team for streamlined access to physical infrastructure network (such as Indexers and validators) and white-glove support , if applicable;
    - various degrees of business and marketing support;
    - technical guidance in select circumstances (whereas normally a firewall is elected between The Graph’s R&D and the incubated projects).

- in return, if these projects graduate from the incubation program and issue a token, there will be a pre-determined percentage minted for The Graph Foundation, which may later decide to distribute its allocation to staked GRT addresses (retroactive mints). The implementation details will vary from project to project. 

## Motivation

Since its inception in 2020, The Graph Network gained a strong reputation and mindshare among developers. Many developers have asked for collaboration opportunities for their projects. Ecosystem participants have offered help from time to time, but there is demand for a more structured program.

Incidentally, many ecosystems are shifting to an incubation or hybrid incubation/grants model. Incubated projects have much better incentive alignment versus grant recipients. Better hands-on support also reduces failure rate, yielding better results for capital deployed.

## Detailed Specification

This proposal specifically sets up a few operating bodies in the ecosystem, overseen by the Foundation. For the avoidance of doubt, the Incubation Committee is **a group within OpCo** (specified below):

- a small Incubation Committee (5-7 people) that determines resource allocation within the program;

- an OpCo that handles business operation and holds the incubation funds;

- potential future budget allocation at the Foundation for OpCo activities. 

The above structure is recommended to:

- isolate financial, legal, and IP risks;

- track accounting and performance metrics;

- create a path for alternative funding structures (grants, co-investment vehicles)

Projects will go through a series of funding stages similar to normal venture cycle:

- Seed/Pre-seed (pre-product/MVP);

- Series A (scaling);

- Series B (acceleration);

- Series C and beyond (large scale expansion);

The program will typically fund early stage (pre-seed through Series A), with potential follow-up funding in subsequent stages. Terms will vary, depending on value-add and market conditions. A small number (1-5) is expected to be qualified for the ecosystem’s formal business development support. 

Funding agreements will typically include a token agreement with a pre-determined allocation to The Graph Foundation, which may later decide to distribute to staked GRT addresses. In absence a token launch, these equity holdings will be owned by the OpCo and eventually capital will be recycled into newer incubated projects.

### Responsibilities of the OpCo

- Set the program’s vision, mission, and long-term strategic goals, and communicate these clearly throughout the organization;

- Devise and execute the incubation strategy;

- Make high-level decisions, including resource allocation, major investments, and risk management;

- Oversee day-to-day operations to ensure alignment with strategic objectives, often delegating but maintaining overall control;

- Budget planning;

- Monitor financial performance and ensure the program meets financial targets. 

### Responsibilities of the Foundation

- Approve strategy and annual budget; provide strategic oversight and guidance;

- Hire and evaluate the program’s executives, including the entire Incubation Committee;

- Monitor and approve major decisions such as mergers, acquisitions, budgets, and executive compensation;

- Oversee risk management;

- Maintain financial oversight, safeguarding OpCo assets and ensuring financial sustainability. 

### Responsibilities of the Incubation Committee

- Incubation Strategy and Policy Oversight

    - Review and approve the incubator's overall allocation strategy

    - Define allocation criteria aligned with the incubator's thesis

    - Establish risk management frameworks and parameters

    - Periodically review and refine incubation strategies based on market conditions and performance

- Deal Evaluation and Decision-making

    - Evaluate prospective incubations presented by the deal team

    - Make final decisions on capital deployment

    - Assess deals against established incubation criteria

    - Challenge assumptions and provide perspective on market trends

    - Review due diligence findings and determine if additional information is needed

- Portfolio Management and Monitoring

    - Monitor the performance of existing incubations

    - Evaluate and approve follow-on incubations

    - Review portfolio company progress against key metrics

    - Assess portfolio balance and diversification

    - Authorize significant changes in incubation strategy or rebalancing

- Governance and Compliance

    - Ensure adherence to the incubator's incubation policies and guidelines

    - Oversee regulatory compliance related to investments

    - Review and address potential conflicts of interest

    - Ensure proper documentation of investment decisions

    - Maintain transparent communication with limited partners
